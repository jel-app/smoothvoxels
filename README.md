This is an optimized and npm packaged fork of the [Smooth Voxels](https://svox.glitch.me/) library by Samuel van Egmond.

It has been updated to use Typed Arrays and bitfields which results in a 5x or so speedup. All features from the main project are supported other than Shells.

A copy of the Smooth Voxel Playground using this library can be found here:

Full documentation can be found here (which applies to both libraries, other than the section on Shells)
