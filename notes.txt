voxels have faces have vertices

vertex data structure {
  x, y, z 12 bytes
  flags (vertex present (1), flatten (1), clamp (1)) 1 byte
  4 32 bit colors 16 bytes
  deform (short) 2 bytes
  warp (short) 2 bytes
  scatter (short) 2 bytes
}

for vertex linking, create a list of offsets to iterate over 

face data structure {
  4 verticies,
  ao 16 bytes
  uv 8 bytes
  flags (flattened, clamped, skipped)
}

bytes per vertex = 12 + 1 + 16 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 37
bytes per face = 4 * 37 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 201
bytes per voxel = 6 * 201 = 1206


check for use of voxels:
- uvassigner, just faces and material
- facealigner just faces
- model, building face, just faces for bounds check
- lightscalculator - material, faces
- vertex transformer - faces
- colorcombiner - material, faces
- vertexlinker - faces
- deformer - faces
- meshgenerator - faces
- normalscalculator - faces
- aocalculator - faces
